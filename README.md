# Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC)
This respository contains code to implement CMAC architecture introduced in the paper "[A New Approach to Manipulator Control: The Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC)](https://github.com/AbhijitMahalle/CMAC/blob/master/research_paper.pdf)" by J. S in 1975. Albus. The model has been trained to learn the function for 2-D parabolic curve. There are two variants of the architecture: Dicrete and continuous and both have been implemented.

## Programming Language
Python

## Instructions to run the code
```
python cmac.py
```
